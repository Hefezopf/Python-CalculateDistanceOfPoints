The Python program calculates the minimum and maximum distance of points.

Sample Coordinates: A(1, 1), B(1, 3), C(4, 4), D(6, 1) 

![Coordinates](Coordinates.png "Coordinates")

Minimum distance of all points = 2.0

Maximum distance of all points = 5.39


## Build

As IDE you can use Visual Studio Code


## Test

Run JUnit Tests

**python apptest.py**


## Run

Run the command line app

**python app.py**

>Start App...
>
>Minimum distance of all points = 2.0
>
>Maximum distance of all points = 5.39

or run with params

**python app.py "(4,3)" "(5,2)" "(1,1)" "(1,2)"**

Calling the app with this params should result in:

>Start App...
>
>Minimum distance of all points = 1.0
>
>Maximum distance of all points = 4.12

Hint: Only use single digit numbers as point coordinates like (4,3)!
